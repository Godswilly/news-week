## Getting started
**I cloned The Newsweek. The main aim was to make the website responsive in devices of different screen sizes.The elements get placed and styled roughly the same way as the source, so functionality is not a priority.**

I used the browser‚Äôs developer tools to inspect the real The Newsweek page to understand how elements are placed and styled using Bootstrap.
I built my own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. I carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go.
  - Create a .css file where all our styling code will reside.
